There are 2 things that I am aware of but did not solve in this project:

1.I assume that the budget txt file ends with a new line at the end. The program directly writes to it without creating a new line.

2.I used three signature strings "!!!", "###" and "@@@" for command types from the client to the server, I assumed that there will be no categories named by these. I know this is a bad habit but I didn't figure out how to get around it.
